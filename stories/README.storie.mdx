# bluenex-storybook

This is a repository to keep potentially reusable components that I have implemented. I have no skill in design at all so some of them might be dull. Also, it may or may not follow the best practice, but consistency will be my priority.

I personally enjoy writing components with styled-components. However, I discovered Chakra UI recently and think it provides an intuitive styled system that helps me a lot. So I am personally attached to these 2 libraries and so that I include them in this repository.

## Requirements

- Node 16+

## Stacks

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- styled-components

## Dev

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## Deployment

```sh
npm run build-storybook
```

This repository will be deployed on Vercel and can be redirected from my personal website https://bluenex.dev/storybook.
