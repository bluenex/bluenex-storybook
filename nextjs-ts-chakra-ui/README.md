# nextjs-ts-chakra-ui

A bare repository to start a new project with Next.js + TypeScript + Chakra UI.

## Known issue

- Chakra UI has not supported React 18 yet but they have worked on V2 for a while. I will be back to upgrade this template when [this issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/5855) is done.
