# Storybook

## Requirements

- Node 14+
- NPM <= 6

## Stacks

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- styled-components
- Tailwind CSS

## Dev

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## Deployment

```sh
npm run build-storybook
```

## Note

`@chakra-ui/storybook-addon` seems to mess storybook docs up, so the docs tab is currently disabled.

**Note:** They are working on v2 to support React 18 but the storybook-addon is on the way to get updated too (https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/5855). Let's wait and see if it solves this problem.
