# nextjs-template

This is a repository to collect nextjs templates that I frequently use.

## Usage

To create a new project from this template, run the following command:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest <project-name> --use-npm --example "https://github.com/bluenex/nextjs-template/tree/main/<base-template>"
```

Where available `base-template`s are:

- `with-tailwind`
- `with-ts-chakra-ui`
- `with-ts-styled-components`
- `with-ts-tailwind`

### Update favicon

Get an icon file (prefer .SVG) and uses that file to generate favicons from this website https://realfavicongenerator.net/. The path to keep favicon is `public/favicon` and the path to refer to favicon files is `/favicon`.

## Requirements

- Node 16+ with NPM 8+

## Stacks

- Next.js [+ TypeScript]
- Chakra UI / Tailwind CSS
