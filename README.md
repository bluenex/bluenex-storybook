# bluenex-storybook

This is a repository to serve my personal storybook. It can also be used as a template for a new project with Next.js + TypeScript + Chakra UI.

To create a new project from this template, run the following command:

```sh
 npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/bluenex/bluenex-storybook
 ```
